When ^C is hit in console.py, the server is terminated.  Instead, the
client should be interrupted (or whatever is possible to implement).

Implement 'console.py file.py <args>'.

Handle the case where sys.stdin is not a terminal (suppress prompt and
banner).

Can unicode handling be improved?  Maybe we should send and receive
the data in whatever encoding the console is using, and handling
decoding/encoding on the PDA?
