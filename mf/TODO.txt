Bugs:

- py2exe\dll.dll is not installed.
- extensions are in the wrong directory when library is in a subdirectory

- (String) Versioninfo not build?  (Needs 'self.version = "6.5"' attribute in Target???)
   Must include this into setup_template.py!

Ideas:

- add some scripts to inspect executables, like dump_manifest.py
- dump_versioninfo.py
- or even a general resource dumper?

TODO:

- services not yet implemented
- DLL com servers not yet implemented
