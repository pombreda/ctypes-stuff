The vtable
----------

Order of virtual methods in the vtable:

It seems the methods appear in the order as they are listed in the
include file.  Overloaded virtual methods appear in the reverse order
from the include file.  Sample::

	vtable offset	method prototype from include file

	0		virtual void V0();
	3		virtual void V1(int x);
	2		virtual void V1();
	1		virtual void V1(char *ptr) {};
	4		virtual void V2();

Pure virtual methods 

TODO
----

Is it possible to get the method addresses from a map file, even when
the class is NOT declared '__declspec(dllexport)'?
