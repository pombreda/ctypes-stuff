Bugs:

- extensions are in the wrong directory when library is in a subdirectory

- (String) Versioninfo not build?  (Needs 'self.version = "6.5"' attribute in Target???)
   Must include this into setup_template.py!

- when installed as egg, py2exe/boot_common.py is not a file and so not found.

Ideas:

- add some scripts to inspect executables, like dump_manifest.py
- dump_versioninfo.py
- or even a general resource dumper?

TODO:

- services not yet implemented
- DLL com servers not yet implemented

Fixed bugs:
  rev336: - py2exe\dll.dll is not installed.
