Bugs:

- distutils catches errors different from DistutilsError (or so)

- distutils_buildexe needs to import DistutilsOptionError (or so)

- Does probably not work with extensions built against the limited API
  (python3.dll)???

Ideas:

- add some scripts to inspect executables, like:
-     dump_manifest.py
-     dump_versioninfo.py
- or even a general resource dumper?

TODO:

- DLL com servers not yet implemented
- test services
- services cmdline_style not yet implemented

Fixed bugs:
  rev 336: - py2exe\dll.dll is not installed.
  rev 342: - when installed as egg, py2exe/boot_common.py is not a file and so not found.
  rev 342: - number of icons (or icon images) is limited for whatever reason.
  rev 342: - extensions are in the wrong directory when library is in a subdirectory
  rev 342: - (String) Versioninfo not build?  (Needs 'self.version = "6.5"' attribute in Target???)
              Must include this into setup_template.py!
  rev 342: - services not yet implemented
